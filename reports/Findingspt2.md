#A) Gender boxplot (math vs reading)

Question: Are there gender differences in math vs reading?

Answer: So it appears that when plotting the boxplots I saw more outliers for the women. So I wanetd to see see the differnce so I found the number of ouliers in each. This showed me that the outliers are all lower scores and more women have these negative ouliers total being 11 outliers for women and 5 for men this can skew the data. However becuase the scores are within the 0-100 range I kept them.  General observations are that in math Men outscored the women while in Reading Women outscored the men.  

#B) Test prep impact on math

Question: Do students who completed test prep score higher in math?

Answer: So at first I wanted to use a scatterplot but then i thought that was silly as it is numeric vrs cateogircal features, so this led me to use another boxplot graph. Although we just used one i felt that it was going to be helpfull to view as we can see the median and the interqusrtile range as well as outliers! This shows us that people who compted the test prep did better median wise and showed a smaller IQR. Meanwhile those who did not complete the test prep showed more outliers ranging in much lower scores with a larger IQR.  This shows us that there is a corolation between completing test prep and scoring better or more consistent.


#C) Lunch type and average performance

Question: Does lunch type (standard vs free/reduced) relate to outcomes?

Answer:  So yes it appears that after finding the mean of the three groups and then grouping it by free/reduces or standard lunches that there is a difference in scores. From it appears that students with standard lunch cost typical scored around 70 meanwhile students on free/reduced lunch score around 62. To me this tell us a diffrence but it is hard to make meanigful conclusions alone bassed on this information, there could be several outside factors that create this difference.  I would say by looking at this it gives me more research questions.  I belive these results fall into a corrolation vrs causation argument where I feel that this is a corrolation not exactly a causation and this is important.

#D) Subject correlations

Question: How strongly do the three subjects move together?

Answer: I would say that they strongly move to one another, the heatmap lowest corrolation is above .80 and higest being 1.0.  Although at first this suprised me it quickly made sense people who score higher on one test would be more likely to score well on another especially with reading and writting since they kinda go hand and hand and my heat map shows this! you can also see that math has the lowest corrolation with the others becuase altough it is still high it has less corolation with reading/wirtting.  I think overall this shows me that that students overall who scores well on one exam also scored well on the others even though there are differnces in hwo trong that realationhsip is.

#E) Math vs reading with trend lines by test prep

a. Question: How strongly are math and reading scores associated, and do students who
completed the test‑preparation course have a different slope in the math–reading
relationship than those who did not?

Answer: To begin with I do not like this graph for this question i think it is too noisy and not clear enough, I would rather have either did what we did above where we grouped the two socres together to see a trend or chosen to solve if mathmatically or maybe even try the two seprate boxplots again. I belive in class we said it should show a max of 3 diffent things this shows 4 and i think it is eaier for me to interpret because i made it.  That being said yes the scatterplot does show a corrolation as it appears the blue dots from "not completing" the tets prep go lower.  Meanwhile the organe for those who did "complete" it go higher and seem to group up more in the higher score range of like it looks like 75-80.
