#A) Gender boxplot (math vs reading)

Question: Are there gender differences in math vs reading?

Answer: So it appears that when plotting the boxplots I saw more outliers for the women. So I wanetd to see see the differnce so I found the number of ouliers in each. This showed me that the outliers are all lower scores and more women have these negative ouliers total being 11 outliers for women and 5 for men this can skew the data. However becuase the scores are within the 0-100 range I kept them.  General observations are that in math Men outscored the women while in Reading Women outscored the men.  

#B) Test prep impact on math

Question: Do students who completed test prep score higher in math?

Answer: So at first I wanted to use a scatterplot but then i thought that was silly as it is numeric vrs cateogircal features, so this led me to use another boxplot graph. Although we just used one i felt that it was going to be helpfull to view as we can see the median and the interqusrtile range as well as outliers! This shows us that people who compted the test prep did better median wise and showed a smaller IQR. Meanwhile those who did not complete the test prep showed more outliers ranging in much lower scores with a larger IQR.  This shows us that there is a corolation between completing test prep and scoring better or more consistent.
