#A) Gender boxplot (math vs reading)

Question: Are there gender differences in math vs reading?

Answer: So it appears that when plotting the boxplots I saw more outliers for the women. So I wanetd to see see the differnce so I found the number of ouliers in each. This showed me that the outliers are all lower scores and more women have these negative ouliers total being 11 outliers for women and 5 for men this can skew the data. However becuase the scores are within the 0-100 range I kept them.  General observations are that in math Men outscored the women while in Reading Women outscored the men.
